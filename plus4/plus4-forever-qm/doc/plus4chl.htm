<h2 align=center>Changes List</h2>

<p>The next bugs fixed and features added since version 1.00 of this emulator 
during 1997/98:

<ul>
<li>debugger can't hang computer after g or p command in long execution
sequence
<li>q debugger command returns to the non-debugger mode of execution and
G debugger command turns emulator in the debugger mode
<li>button End correctly works in menus
<li>added analog joysticks support
<li>screen size sets to 320x207
<li>TED algorithm slightly modified
</ul>

<p>bugs fixed in v1.12 (XI-2002)

<ul>
<li>made correct kernal $FCxx page fix
<li>made correct loading of PRG-files with tape origin, like PACMANIA
</ul>

<p>features of v1.14

<ul>
<li>added full range of joysticks emulation options
<li>vertical synchronization set to 50.1Hz (early it was 54.6Hz)
<li>added possibility to use the underscore symbol in the filenames in the
menus
</ul>

<p>features of v1.15

<ul>
<li>it's the last version of emulator which can run at 100% speed at P100
</ul>

<p>features of v1.16 (III-2003)

<ul>
<li>improved interrupts handling &mdash; it does possible to run <em>Icicle 
Works</em> without problems
<li>added poor digital sound effects support (that reached by reducing delays
after writing to AdLib ports and may create problems with very old cards)
<li>it's the last version of the emulator which can run at 100% speed at P133
</ul>

<p>features of v1.17 (IV-2003)

<ul>
<li>added PC speaker sound support &mdash; this does possible to hear digital 
sound effects (use F5 to change sound hardware) and does impossible to run the
emulator from Microsoft Windows
<li>added O (watchpOint) command to the debugger
<li>added speed regulation to the menus
<li>completely rewritten synchronization codes (now it based on the timer
    37.3KHz interrupt)
<li>added support for mouse buttons to the emulator
<li>fixed some minor bugs
</ul>

<p>features of v1.18 (V-2003)

<ul>
<li>first version for free assembler (FASM) under GNU GPL
<li>fixed some bugs
</ul>

<p>features of v1.19 (VII-2003)

<ul>
<li>better hardware interrupts handling algorithm (old one could cause crash
of menus subsystem and hanging of computer with DR-DOS, Free-DOS, and
PTS-DOS, but worked good on Microsoft MS-DOS!)
<li>better synchronization code
<li>renamed KERNEL.ROM to KERNAL.ROM
<li>fixed several bugs in the debugger
<li>added some little improvements to the TED subroutine (that cause better
look of the games <em>Squirm</em>, <em>Jailbreak</em>, ...)
<li>menus: added DELETE command (it can't remove read-only files) and one
navigation bug fixed
<li>it's first named version of the emulator (`Navsegda?' in Russian)
<li>slightly improved PC speaker sound code
<li>better drive letters handling
<li>CD-ROMs support added
<li>improved LED (lock keys indicators) handling
</ul>

<p>features of v1.20 (VII-2003)

<ul>
<li>joysticks and sound states saved now in C2F
</ul>

<p>features of v1.21 (VIII-2003)

<ul>
<li>fixed some bugs, added some minor improvements
<li>added tape utilities CTF2WAV, CTF2TAP, and WAV2CTF
</ul>

<p>features of v1.22 (IX-2003)

<ul>
<li>fixed some bugs, added some minor improvements
</ul>

<p>features of v1.23 (XI-2003)

<ul>
<li>fixed BRK instruction, BASIC 7.0 cartridge is now supported
</ul>

<p>features of v1.24 (II-2004)

<ul>
<li>added hardware reset function
<li>fixed some bugs
</ul>

<p>features of v1.25 (VI-2004)

<ul>
<li>added nearly exact timing. Three write only cycles for CPU during DMA are
still not emulated
<li>fixed some bugs
</ul>

<p>features of v1.26 (VII-2004)

<ul>
<li>added several minor improvements
<li>fixed some bugs
</ul>

<p>features of v1.27 (VIII-2004)

<ul>
<li>fixed bug which caused impossibility to load read-only files from 
menu &mdash; this did files from boot diskette (cbm264c) unloadable
</ul>

<p>features of v1.28 (X-2004)

<ul>
<li>added poor disk drive (device #8 only) support by interception of
$FFD5 calls. It becomes possible to use LOAD and DLOAD. This makes more than
1/3 of D64-images usable
<li>the file deletion is intercepted by "Are you sure?" question now
<li>fixed some minor bugs
</ul>

<p>features of v1.29 (XII-2004)

<ul>
<li>slightly improved disk drive support (this makes more than
40% of D64-images usable)
<li>added some minor improvements
</ul>

<p>v1.31 (VIII-2005)

<ul>
<li>added nearly full support for the disk drives (this makes
more than 90% of D64-images usable), but evade turbo-loaders
<li>added some minor improvements
</ul>

<p>v1.32 (I-2006)

<ul>
<li>added DOS write commands for the D64-images (SAVE, PRINT, COLLECT, ...)
<li>established 99.9% exactness in the TED/CPU cooperative activity &mdash;
that made possible to see all (?) FLIs &mdash; this improvement made the
emulator about 14% slower
<li>commands GL (goto line) and Y (TED cycle) are added to the debugger
<li>fixed many minor bugs
</ul>

<p>v1.33 (V-2006)

<ul>
<li>fixed some bugs
</ul>

<p>v1.34 (IX-2006)

<ul>
<li>added support for different screen sizes &mdash; many VGA and VESA 
modes became available &mdash; this slow the emulator down
by 5-30% (it is still possible to run the emulator at 100% speed at 
Pentium-200 without frames skipping)
<li>added frame skipping mechanism. It can speed the emulator up to 50%
<li>added CFG-file support. This file is named 
PLUS4.CFG and contains information about video card mode, frame skipping 
and music card
<li>code became compatible with newest versions of FASM
</ul>

<p>v1.35 (II-2007)

<ul>
<li>improved datasette emulation code: removed <em>surprizing</em> message
"assign a file ...", added direct TAP format support, ...;
<li>fixed some disk drive emulation errors (thanks to SVS of Fire);
<li>added command line parameter support &mdash; it made possible to
use a PRG file for autoload (this feature was requested by Ninja / The
Dreams);
<li>provided proper emulation of the bit 1 of the TED $1e register;
<li>fixed some minor bugs;
<li>THIS VERSION CONTAINS BUG WHICH MAY CORRUPT D64-IMAGES - DON'T USE IT!
</ul>

<p>v1.36 (III-2007)

<ul>
<li>some IEC emulation errors are removed
</ul>


<p>v1.37 (VIII-2007)

<ul>
<li>added possibility to use advanced command line options;
<li>added support for the relative files at D64-images (this allows to run
SVS BALsys from a D64-file);
<li>fixed some bugs
</ul>


<p>v1.38 (IX-2007)

<ul>
<li>added possibility to use ROM and CFG files in the command line options;
<li>fixed some bugs
</ul>


<p>v1.39 (XII-2007)

<ul>
<li>added possibility to set video mode in the command line
options;
<li>fixed one bug in the IEC error channel emulation
</ul>


<p>v1.40 (XII-2007)

<ul>
<li>added Sound Blaster support;
<li>removed error which caused wrong loading of some C2F-files from cmd line;
<li>added possibility to select sound hardware from the command line
</ul>

<p>v1.41 (I-2008)

<ul>
