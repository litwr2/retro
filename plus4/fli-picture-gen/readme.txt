Just make your picture in the p4prg source using the setbmc function that
sets a pixel on the FLI screen that has 160x224 size, 2 free colors
in each 4x2 matrix, and additional 2 free colors for each raster line

If you have the out.prg file you don't need to compile svn.asm

On the PAL you can use 160x256 screen size
