Just create your picture in the C code using the *setpa* function which sets a pixel on the FLI screen that has 160xVSIZE size, 2 free colors in each 4x2 matrix, and additional 2 free colors for each raster line.  VSIZE can be changed in the **svn.asm** file.  It can be in the range of 200-280.  On the NTSC system it is possible to use up to 224 lines, on the PAL system - 280.  However only 256 raster lines are visible on the old PAL monitors.  Your code must include the **fligen.c** file in your code.

The **build-asm** script generates the **out.prg** binary file and the **svn.h** include file that contains the definition of VSIZE for the C code.

The **out.prg** must be used as the skeleton of the assembly code that is generated by your program.  The next example shows how the system works.

		int main() {
			FILE *fi = fopen("out.prg", "r");
			int co = fread(prg + 0xfff, 1, 65535, fi);
			fclose(fi);
			/* the start of graphics */
			...
			/* the finish of graphics */
			fi = fopen("out1.prg", "w");
			fwrite(prg + 0xfff, 1, co, fi);
			fclose(fi);
		}

This code creates the **out1.prg** file that can be loaded into the C+4.
